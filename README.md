Asus DSL-N55U Custom Firmware 
Codename: Bender
===============

This project is a merge of two important projects about Asus manufactered router and modems: **AsusWRT** and **AsusWRT-Merlin**.

Codename Bender extends the support of the well known **AsusWRT-Merlin** to _Ralink_ based devices (eg. _DSL-N55U_).

The main purpose of the project is to create new lightweight version of the firmware in order to increase modem/router performances, providing a new and better gui.

Any support/feedback is always welcome!
